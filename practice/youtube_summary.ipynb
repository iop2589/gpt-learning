lion Camala Harris honestly I believe she was born that way low IQ she's a low IQ individual stupid people like K she she's a stupid person she's further left than Bernie Sanders or or Pocahontas now Pocahontas we can't stand you you're a vice president she's grossly incompetent she cannot be trusted and she is totally IL equipped to do the job of being president of the United States Camala you're fired get the hell out of here get out we're going to defeat Camala Harris I know Donald Trump's type as a prosecutor I specialized in child sexual abuse cases and sexual abuse cases well Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse and as an attorney general I held the Big Wall Street Banks accountable for fraud Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud 34 counts well [Applause] Donald I do hope you'll consider to meet me on the debate [Applause] stage because as the same goes if you got something to say my face live from the critical Battleground state of Pennsylvania Martha RIT good you have fun thank you welcome to you both it's wonderful to have you it's an honor to have you both here tonight she's a Marxist everybody knows she's a Marxist her father's a Marxist professor in economics and he taught her well but when you look at what she's done to our country and when you look at these millions and millions of people that are pouring into our country monthly it is well known he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong-un and it is absolutely wellknown that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again because they're so clear they can manipulate you with flattery and favors and let me say can afford to do it and what you are putting H and the people of America have not the majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body probably took in Springfield they're eating the dogs the people that came in they're eating the cats they're eating they're eating the pets of the people that live there Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War and what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess if Donald Trump were Pres trying to separate herself away from Biden but she can't go too far away from Biden because she's connected to you know she's got him in office right now her performance was just her rhetoric it's not anything that has been done we look at three and a half years for [Music] [Music] [Applause] TR McDonald I'm looking for a jent trump I'm Derek Jack I love McDonald's I love jobs I like to see good jobs that's pry she never worked at McDonald's McDonald's just confirmed that again by the way she never worked at McDonald's in other words she's lion kamla how are you your new baby how are you how are [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you you know even though Trump claims to be very rich uh in terms of his personal habits and and cultural instincts he actually is much closer to workingclass Americans than Democrats were well educated you know they went to IV League schools and so forth Trump likes to eat McDonald's hamburgers and he likes wrestling and he goes to you know uh these big fighting matches and you know he doesn't have refined tastes and I think that people like that I think a lot of workingclass people when they look at him even you know even his richness uh speaks to a desire of many ordinary Americans to be rich I've been my my grandma my grandma come on you have a I do that tackling inflation but day one really for kamla was she destroys everything she touches and if she wins your finances in your country will never recover you're never going to recover [Music] Trump e [Music] [Music] it is Trump has to win this where something bad is going to happen into this country and I think we're going to win this Trump is the best hey now you're working there you go buddy go Trump baby go Trump four years ago my life was so much easier than it is now we have to shop three different places whatever to just to make ends meat to buy the things we need to save some money cuz things are so expensive um Biden and KLA ruined the economy you know and Trump's going and then they open up the borders that was a that's a mess the the thing is with KLA Harris she's had over three and A2 years to do something she's been what she's been second in command you would think that she would be able to get something done and now all a sudden she's saying that she's going to do this when she's already in powerered to do it so yeah so you don't believe come as a prise no I don't believe anything she says no I do not Harris has no plan at all she doesn't know what she's doing she doesn't understand basic economics and to go around and say you must raise taxes taxes are going to have to go up no I mean it's kind of the Democrat solution is they just think you raise taxes and they collect more money to by the way spend horribly and send it to other countries and they don't do what they're supposed to do here working people felt left behind and more than that they felt looked down upon be by Elites Donald Trump promised to seek a kind of Retribution against the elites the media Elites the academic Elites the intellectual Elites who many working people felt looked down on them working people feel that Trump hears them that he listens to them drill baby drill drill baby drill drill baby drill drill baby drill we're going to have so much energy and we're going to bring prices [Music] down as far as my opinion I I believe the man has enough common sense to realize that this is this is a source of income it's a source of bargaining in the world [Music] [Music] starting on day one I will approve new drilling new pipelines new refineries new power plants new reactors and we will slash the red tape under President Trump America's future will be energy abundance energy Independence and soon we will be energy dominant we're going to be dominant [Music] at this time it is 611 12 weeks to the minute that the shooting began and I would like to ask everyone to join me in a moment of [Music] silence take over El take over [Applause] well first of all I want to say what an honor it is to be here and uh you know the the true test of someone's character is how they behave Under Fire fight fight fight blood coming down the [Applause] face I have a surprise for you uh which is that uh we are going to be awarding a million dollar to randomly to people who have signed the signed the petition every day from now until the [Applause] election had no no idea so um anyway you're [Music] welcome oh p for Y and I think that what's different about the second Trump Administration is that uh he now has had some practice in particular he also knows how to wield executive Authority in a way that could really change the bureaucracy so to the extent that there will be noticeable changes it will probably be uh fundamental changes to the federal bureaucracy under no circumstances you are promising America tonight you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody except for day one except for he's going crazy except for day one meaning [Applause] [Music] us leadership has been undermined uh not by other countries but by the US South Korea is an example of a country that has benefited from international trade and the International Security order uh and so I would understand if Koreans are particularly worried about this good to see you do okay let's do South Korea I love South Korea they're wonderful people extremely ambitious they have a money machine we protect them from North Korea for no drugs no alcohol no cigarettes raise your hands kids I promise Donald J Trump that I will never take drugs I will never take drugs I don't want to say no alcohol but take it easy on the Alcohol right and you know what else no cigarettes right all right kids come here come here and I think you the Washington Monument you keep learning you keep trying and you keep dreaming one day you might be standing exactly right here where I'm standing I want to tell you it's not that [Applause] easy the hard and difficult questions will be will he really be able to make life better for the voters who put their faith in him in tangible ways or will he his presidency simply be an instrument of grievance four years of Retribution and retaliation against enemies and the expression of grievance that will be the question [Applause] [Applause] myir [Music]\")]"

1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가이 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하앤는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환화할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 보조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커분이 말씀하신 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 방력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량이 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이지원 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대 전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타녀 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안부실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청회부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병보대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청회부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 발혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방망 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네, 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 1의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국회대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 >> 안녕하십니까? >> 예. 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음네. 아니 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 >> 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 강교는 보통 이제 압박을할 때 우선시도 후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배유라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르몬 제업을 맡게 어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나 하메이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모로나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 궁군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소유 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 정 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프펜부는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형회화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해업을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 어 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다에서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 데뷔를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전란 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 커분대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 이란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전국인을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 어 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해협이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유값 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이지원 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대 전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안부실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청회부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병보대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청회부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방망 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네, 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 1의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국회대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 >> 안녕하십니까? >> 예. 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음네. 아니 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 >> 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을할 때 우선시도 후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배율이라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르몬 제업을 맡게 어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대층 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나 하메이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모로나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 궁군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소유 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 정 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프펜부는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 행정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형회화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 어 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 평화해서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 코이요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 데뷔를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전란 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 커분대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노는 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 이란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전국인을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 어 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해협이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유값 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이지원 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수위간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 일했으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다.이지 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병보대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 발혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방망 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네, 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 1의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국회대 중동위원 연구원소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 >> 안녕하십니까? >> 예. 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음네. 아니 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 >> 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 강교는 보통 이제 압박을 가할 때 우선시도 후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고주시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배율이라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르몬 제업을 맞게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 예. 지금 미국의 그군사작전이 보시면 그 비대 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나 하메이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모로나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 저 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 궁군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소유 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하던 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프 정부는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 행정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형회화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해업을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 어 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 평화해서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 코이요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 좀 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 데뷔를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전란 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트 UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 커분대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 이란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 당력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 어 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해협이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해 이란내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵 프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이스라엘 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다. 이어 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합남뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이지윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대 전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타니어 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이라는 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이름 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수위간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견양한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다. 이어 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관는 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습 직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부은 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네, 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 1의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국회대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 >> 안녕하십니까? >> 예. 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음네. 아니 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 >> 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 강교는 보통 이제 압박을할 때 우선시도 후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배율이라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 얘네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르몬 제업을 맞게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 예. 지금 미국의 그군사작전이 보시면 그 비대 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나 하메이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모로나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 저 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 궁군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소유 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프 정부는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 행정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형회화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 어 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 평화해서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 코이요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 데뷔를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전란 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 보의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 커분대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 이란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 당력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 어 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해협이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유값 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해 이란내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이사라 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다. 이어 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신들은 이번 공격이 수위간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관는 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습 직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 이렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 보통 이제 압을할 때 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매달 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 뭡니까? 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 헬항무나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소요 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가다비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하던 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 어 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁명이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을화할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 무대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커분이 말씀하신 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한돼 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량이 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다.이지 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵 프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이스라엘 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열람뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다. 이어 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해 이란내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신들은 이번 공격이 수간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견향한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다. 이어 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관는 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습 직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백승은 한국회대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까? 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 이렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압을할 때 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매달 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 배치된 병력을 보면 육해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소요 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하던 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼팬저분부는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 무대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커분이 말씀하신 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점이 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한돼 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤드볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 것 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해 이란내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵 프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이사라 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안부실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다. 이어 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이름 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신들은 이번 공격이 수간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견향한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관는 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습 직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부은 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국회대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까? 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 이렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매달 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고주시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 헬항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보 배치된 병력을 보면 육해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소요 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가다비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하던 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼팬저분부는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁명이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을화할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커분이 말씀하신 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한돼 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤드볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량이 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이지원 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다. 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이름 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신자들은 이번 공격이 수위간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견향한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다. 이어 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관는 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습 직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부은 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네, 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 1의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국회대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 >> 안녕하십니까? >> 예. 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음네. 아니 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 >> 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 강교는 보통 이제 압박을할 때 우선시도 후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배율이라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르몬 제업을 맞게 어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 예. 지금 미국의 그군사작전이 보시면 그 비대 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나 하메이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모로나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 궁군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소유 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프 정부는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 행정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형회화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 어 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 평화해서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 코이요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 데뷔를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전란 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트 UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 커분대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 이란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 어 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 당력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 어 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해협이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다.이지 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다. 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타녀 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병보대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 발혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방망 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네, 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 1의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국회대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 >> 안녕하십니까? >> 예. 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음네. 아니 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 >> 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을할 때 우선시도 후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배율이라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르몬 제업을 맞게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 예. 지금 미국의 그군사작전이 보시면 그 비대 이란의 비대층 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나 하메이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모로나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 저 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 궁군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소유 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프펜부는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 행정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형회화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 어 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다에서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 코이요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 데뷔를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전란 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 커대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노는 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 이란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 당력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 어 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해협이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유값 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다.이지 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가?

>> 예. 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음네. 아니 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 >> 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 강교는 보통 이제 압박을할 때 우선시도 후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배유라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르몬 제업을 맡게 어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나 하메이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모로나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 궁군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소유 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 정 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 행정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형회화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 어 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다에서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 데뷔를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전란 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 커분대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노는 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 이란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 어 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해협이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유값 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이지원 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이지윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대 전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타녀 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 허상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병보대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 발혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방망 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백승은 한국회대 중동위원 연구원 연구원소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매덜 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그니까 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가이 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육에서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하던 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투 트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향후 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하앤는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 무대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커분 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이사라 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 인글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합남뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이지윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이름 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견양한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보 부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방망 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백승은 한국회대 중동위원 연구원소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까? 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 네. 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 이렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가이 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보 배치된 병력을 보면 육해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하던 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하앤는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을화할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 무대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커분 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한돼 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 사항이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 방력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량이 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이사라 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열람뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안부실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합남뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이름 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신들은 이번 공격이 수간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견양한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보 부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국대 중동위원 연구원소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 네. 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 이렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매덜 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가이 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 저 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 샤워 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커분이 말씀하신 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분는 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량이 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해 이란내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이사라 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열람뉴스 TV 이지윤입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합남뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이지윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이름 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신들은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견양한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보 부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙쳤습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백송은 한국회대 중동위원 연구원 연구원소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 네. 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 이렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매덜 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가이 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육에서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투 트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하앤는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커분이 말씀하신 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해 이란내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이사라 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 인글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합남뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이름 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신들은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견양한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보 부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙쳤습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습 직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까? 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍의 하이는 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 이렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매덜 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가이 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보 배치된 병력을 보면 육에서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하던 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하앤는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을화할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 무대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커분이 말씀하신 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량이 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수위간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다.이지 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타녀 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 허상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병보대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청회부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 발혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방망 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네, 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 1의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국회대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 >> 안녕하십니까? >> 예. 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음네. 아니 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 >> 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을할 때 우선시도 후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배율이라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르몬 제업을 맡게 어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 군사작이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대층 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나 하메이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모로나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 궁군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소유 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 정 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 행정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형회화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해업을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 어 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다에서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 코이요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 데뷔를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전란 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 커대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노는 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 이란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전국인을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 당력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 어 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해협이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유값 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수위간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다.이지 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타녀 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병보대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 발혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락망 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네, 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 1의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국회대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 >> 안녕하십니까? >> 예. 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음네. 아니 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 >> 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 강교는 보통 이제 압박을할 때 우선시도 후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배유라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르몬 제업을 맡게 어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나 하메이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모로나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 궁군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소유 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 행정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형회화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 어 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다에서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 코이요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 데뷔를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전란 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 커분대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노는 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 이란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전국인을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해협이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유값 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 무방 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 인글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보 부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다.이지 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대 전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타녀 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청회부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병보대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청회부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 발혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방망 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네, 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 1의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국회대 중동위원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 >> 안녕하십니까? >> 예. 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음네. 아니 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 >> 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 강교는 보통 이제 압박을 가할 때 우선시도 후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배율이라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르몬 제업을 맡게 어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모로나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 궁군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소유 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 정권 전복을 하던 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 행정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형회화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 어 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다에서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 코이요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 데뷔를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전란 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 커분대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노는 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 그 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 이란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전국을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 당력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 어 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해협이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유값 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이사라 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합남뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이지윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민네이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견양한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보 부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙쳤습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백숭은 한국대 중동위원 연구원소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까? 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 네. 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매달 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가이 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보 배치된 병력을 보면 육해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투 트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향후 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하앤는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커분이 말씀하신 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 방력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량이 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가수 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이사라 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열람뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이스라엘 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이름 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신들은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견향한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙쳤습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관는 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방망 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백승은 한국회대 중동위원 연구원소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까? 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 네. 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을 가할 때 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매덜 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그니까 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육에서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을화할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트 UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 무대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커신 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 것 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열람뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 제시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안부실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합남뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이지윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이름 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신들은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견양한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보 부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙쳤습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습 직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백승은 한국회대 중동위원 연구원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 네. 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매달 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보어 배치된 병력을 보면 육에서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묶고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하던 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투 트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하앤는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을화할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트 UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 무대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커분이 말씀하신 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 사항이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 이사라 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 인글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열람뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다. 이어 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다.이지 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타녀 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청회부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병보대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관은 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 발혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방망 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백승은 한국회대 중동위원 연구원 연구소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 네. 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 이렇게 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매덜 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그니까 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 해항모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보 배치된 병력을 보면 육해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가닥비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투 트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일안의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하앤는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을화할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운신 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 무대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분론 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지들 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재훈 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해 이란내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이어 이란이 핵프그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 인글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후 선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보부처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가 안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다. 이어 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청회부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최후선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최후선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 네. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타냐 위사일 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발음과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비의 대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이름 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신대는 이번 공격이 수간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 견양한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙쳤습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외교부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방구 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관는 동명, 청해부대 등 파병부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부는 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백승은 한국회대 중동위원 연구원소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까? 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 네. 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그 빌드업 하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 방교는 보통 이제 압박을 우선시도후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망을 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매덜 며칠까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배우라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르무 제업을 맡게 어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그 어 군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그니까 혁명 수비대나이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 헬항로나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 저 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 공군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소태가 일어나고 어 시민 소요 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하던 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명령을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 어 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명명했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정 정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형회화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 형화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다 형화해서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 포요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 대비를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비대라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 어 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 지금 앵커 말씀하신 대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노는 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 캐퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한돼 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤드볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지들 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 미란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 봉쇄 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에다가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대 상력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제업을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 이런 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해업이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국에대 중동 연구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다.이지 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 네타녀 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의이는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이란은 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘 군도 이단에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프로그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러싸고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지윤입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승곡 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다.이 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 위기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대 전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 이란이 핵프로그램 재건을 시도했다며이란 미사일 산업과 해군을 파괴할 거라고 선언했습니다. 배타녀 위사 총리도 미국과 함께이란 정권이 제기하는 위협을 제거하기 위한 군사 작전에 착수했다고 말했습니다. 이날이란 수도 테일란에는 여러 차례 폭발과 함께 연기가 솟아오르는 모습이 포착됐습니다.이란 최고 지도자 하민이의 진무실 잉글에서 폭발이 일어났는데 하민의는 테란이 아닌 다른 안전한 곳에 있었던 것으로 전해집니다. 이란도 즉각 보복 공격에 나섰습니다. 이라는 이번 공격이 국제법을 위반한 침략 행위라고 규탄하며 이스라엘의 드론과 미사일을 발사했다고 밝혔습니다. 혁명 수비대변인은 대응은 향후 몇 시간 안에 올 거라며 이란에 대한 공격은 이스라엘의 오산이라고 주장했습니다. 이스라엘군도 이란에서 발사된 미사일이 포착됐다며 방공망을 가동해 미사일 요을 시도하고 있다고 전했습니다. 이번 공격은 핵프그램, 탄도 미사일 등을 둘러세고 이란과 미국 긴장이 최고조의 이른 가운데 발생했습니다. 외신자들은 이번 공격이 수일간 집중적으로 진행될 예정이라고 전했습니다. 열라뉴스 TV 이지훈입니다. >> 네. 이렇게 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 공격한 것과 관련해 이재명 대통령은 우리 교민의 안전을 최우선시해 달라고 지시했습니다. 지금까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 걸로 확인된 가운데 청와대는 외교 안보부처가 참여하는 NSC 실무위원회를 긴급 개최했습니다. 이승국 기자입니다. 미국과 이스라엘이 이란을 겨냥한 대규모 군사 작전을 개시한 가운데 이재명 대통령은 관련 상황을 보고받고 대책을 점검했습니다. 강유정 청와대 대변인은 언론 공지를 통해이 대통령은 이러한 상황을 보고받고 국내에 미치는 영향과 관련 대책 등을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 이어이 대통령이 이란과 인근 지역의 우리 교민 안전을 최후선시해 달라고 지시했다고 전했습니다. 청와대는 외교안보처가 참여하는 국가 안전보장 회의 NSC 실무위원회를 열어 향후 대응 방안 등을 논의했습니다. 청와대 국가안보실은 우리 정부는 현이란 관련 상황을 예의 주시하고 있으며 영내 긴장을 완화시키기 위해 모든 당사자들이 최대한 노력을 기울일 것을 촉구한다고 밝혔습니다. 이어 우리 정부는 이란의 체류 중인 우리 국민의 안전 확보를 위해 만전을 기하고 있다고 덧붙였습니다. 정부 움직임도 분주합니다. 외부은 김진아 2차관 주제로 상황 점검회를 열고 이란내 교민 안전 대책 등을 논의했습니다. 이란에는 지난 달 기준 교민 70여명이 체류하고 있으며 현재까지 파악된 우리 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 국방부도 중동지역 파병부대 안전 점검에 나섰습니다. 안규백 국방부 장관은 동명부대와 청해부대 등 해외 파병 부대의 안전 상황을 즉각 점검하고 부대원들의 안전을 최우선으로 고려해 임무를 수행할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했다고 국방부가 전했습니다. 진영승 합차무장도 해외 파병부대장들과 직접 화상회를 실시해 상황을 보고받고 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선에 권리하도록 지침을 전달했다고 합참히 밝혔습니다. 연합뉴스 TV 이승국입니다. >> 네. 국방부와 합동 참모본부는 미국과 이스라엘의이란 폭격 상황과 관련해 파병부대들의 위협 상황을 점검했으며 현재까지 파병부대의 안전에 이상이 없는 걸로 확인했다고 밝혔습니다. 진영승 합참의장은 해외 파병 부대장들과 직접 화상 회의를 실시해 현 상황을 보고받았으며 해외 파병부대 장병과 재외 국민의 안전을 최우선으로 관리하도록 전달했습니다. 앞서 안규백 국방부장관는 동명, 청회부대 등 파병 부대의 상황을 즉각 점검할 것을 관련 부서에 지시했습니다. 네. 현재까지 접수 파악된 이란과 이스라엘 내 국민 피해는 없는 것으로 확인됐습니다. 외교부는 오늘 주이란 대사관, 주 이스라엘 대사관 등과 합동 상황 점검 회의를 개최하고 교민 안전 대책을 점검했다고 밝혔습니다. 현지 대사관들은 공습 직후 교민을 대상으로 안전 공지를 전파하고 비상 연락방 등을 통해 안전을 확인하고 있다고 전했습니다. 외교부은 중동향을 지속 예의 주시하면서 유사시 대피 계획 마련 등 우리 국민 안전 확보를 위해 필요한 조치를 취해 나갈 예정이라고 밝혔습니다. 네. 계속 전해드리고 있는데요. 이란의 핵 보유를 허용하지 않겠다던 미국과 이스라엘이 이란에 대해서 전격 공습을 단행했습니다. 이란도 보복을 선명했는데요. 양측의 직접적인 군사충돌 지난해 6월 이란의 핵시설과 군사 지도부가 심각한 손상을 입은 12일 전쟁 이후에 약 8개월 만입니다. 관련 내용은 백승훈 한국회대 중동위원 연구원소 전임 연구원 전화로 연결해서 들어보겠습니다. 박사님 나와 계십니까?네 네, 안녕하십니까? >> 예, 먼저 미국의 이란에 대한 공격 가능성 계속해서 뭐 이야기는 좀 인박하고 있다라는 얘기 나왔었는데요. 오늘 오후를 공격 타이밍으로 잡은 이유가 있는지 박사님께서는 좀 예상을 하셨는지요? >> 음, 네. 아니, 아무도 예상은 하지 못했죠. 어느 타이밍에 하이는. 그렇지만 이제 인박했다라는 것은 다 보고 있었습니다. 왜냐면 요번 타이밍이 즉흥적이라기보다는 사전에 이미 준비하고 계획했던 하나의 그 계획 안에서 벌어진 것이거든요. 근데 우리가 여기서 조금 어 착각하지 말아야 될 것은 그러니까 어차피 협상은 소위 말해서 그 위장이었고 그 공격을 하려고 그렇게 빌드업하지 않았느냐 그렇게 보시면 안 되고요. 지금 미국의 트럼프 행정부가 그 이란행정 이란과 같이 협상을 하는 그 과정을 강압 외교라고 하는 하나의 큰 프레임으로 봐야 됩니다. 강화교는 보통 이제 압박을 가할 때 우선시도 후 관망 이렇게 해라하고 관망하고 지켜보는 과정 그다음에 그 압박을 점점 고조시켜시키는 나사조이는 과정 그니까 압박의 고조 과정 그다음에 어 그니까 안묵적 최후 통첩 그러니까 어떤 어 소위 말해서 어떤 기간을 정하진 않지만 이때까지 네가 하지 않으면 공격을 받을 수 있다라고 하는 그 과정까지 이렇게 압박을 하고 최후 통첩이라고 그 마지막에는 야 매월 매출까지 우리가 원하는 나는 뒤를 안 갖고 오면 우리 전쟁할 수밖에 없다. 이렇게 압박을 고조시키면서 상대방을 굴복시키는 거거든요. 물론 그 과정에서는 이런 군사적 폭력이나 군사적 압박을 사용할 수 있지만 결국은 이것은 전면전으로 가지 않고 이런 식으로 그 소위 말해서 그 공중 폭격이나 이런 것들을 이용해서 상대방을 상대방이 쓸 수 없는 카드를 다 소진시키고 벽에 몰아넣어서 그 결국은 그 종국에는 자기가 원하는 결과물을 얻는 그런 그 소위 말해서 폭력은 사용하지만 외교적으로 해결하려고 하는 그 방식 그 그걸 강화배율이라고 하는데 그 과정에서 벌어진 일이라고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. 그래서 지금 시점은 왜 이렇게 됐느냐? 1차 2차 제네바 협약을 통해서 아 이란이 어 좀 이렇게 수능적으로 나오지 않는구나. 그러면 우리가 얘기했던 너 이렇게 말 안 듣더가는 우리가 이런 식의 공격도 할 수 있고 너의 그 너네들이 그 억지 능력 그러니까 소위 말해서 미국의 공격에 억지를 가할 수 있는 그런 소위 지금 이란이 쓸 수 있는 가장 큰 핵심 카드는 미사일 전력 아니면 호르몬 제업을 맞게 어어 봉쇄하겠다라는 것이거든요. 그래서 지금 미국의 그군사작전이 보시면 그 비대층 이란의 비대칭 전력인 드론이나 그 탄도 미사일 시설을 공격하고 그다음에 그 이란의 해군 세력들한테 공격을 가한다라고 하는 것이 이제 군사 작전으로 되고 있으면서 지금 어떻게 보면 이란의 정책 결정자 그룹이죠. 그러니까 혁명 수비대나 하메이나 최고 지도자나 이런 사람들한테 어 생명을 우리가 뺏어 갈 수 있다라고 하는 압박을 가하면서 어떻게 보면 어 이란이 네가 쓸 수 있는 카드가 이제 없다. 그러니까 굴복을 하든지 항복을 하라. 이런 식으로 이제 그 어 계획이 돼 있던 군사 작전이 개시됐다고 보면 됩니다. 근데 여기서 한 가지 좀 재밌는 부분은 요게 있습니다. 지금이 트럼프 대통령이 그이란 국민들한테 발신을 하는 그 발 그 메시지거든요. 지금 뭐라 그랬냐면이란 국민들아 들고 일어나라. 지금 이게 너네들의 마지막 그 기회다.이 너네들이 국가를 전복하고 이렇게 해라 이렇게 얘기하고 있고 이스라엘 국방부에도 이런 얘기를 하고 있습니다. 결국은 이렇게 밀어붙여서이란 국민이 자신의 미래를 결정할 수 있게 하겠다.이 얘기는 뭐냐면 맥락을 같이 합니다. 지금 미국이나 이스라엘이 이란의 지상군을 파견할 수 있는 상황은 아니거든요. 지금 미국이 가장 최대 그 그 하로모나 이런 것들을 2003년 이후에 많이 배치하고 있다고 하지만 지금 보 배치된 병력을 보면 육 어 서위 말해서 전면전 육군 병력은 없고 해군과 궁군 병력입니다. 그럼 결국은 그런 공중 타격을 할 수밖에 없는 그 병력들만가 있는데 이것은 뭘 의미하냐면 저는 리비아 모델을 생각합니다. 무슨 말이냐면 가다비가 무너질 때 그 시민 소요 사태가 일어나고 어 시민 소유 사태가 일어나서 계속 고조가 될 때 미국이 리비아를 노플라이존 비행 금지역으로 어 묻고 가닥비의 군을 폭격으로 해서 그 형회화시키면서 소요 그 시민 세력들이 계속해서 어 전 정권 전복을 하는 그 작전들을 하게 했거든요. 그래서 이런 것들을 보면 지금 어 트럼프 정부는 투트랙으로 가고 있는 것이라고 보 보면 될 것 같습니다. 향 이런 것들이 안 됐을 때에 노리 노리는 것 그리고 그 그다음에 국가 전복이 됐을 때이 그이란이란 세력들을 이용해서 이렇게 전복시키려고 하는 그 두 가지의 트랙으로 지금 밀어붙인다고 보시면 될 거 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 협상부터 오늘의 공격에 이르기까지 강하게 압박을 해오는 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 있다라는 말씀으로 좀 듣겠습니다. 메타냐 이스라엘 총리가요. 이번 작전을 사자의 포효라고 명을 했거든요.이 같은 군사 작전의 목표가 또 관심입니다. 트럼프 대통령은 지금 이란의 미사일 뭐 해군 핵등을 언급하지 않았습니까? 어떻게 보고 계시는지요? 뭐 이게 어떻게 연장 선상입니다. 우리가 작년 6월에 벌어졌던 이스라엘이 먼저 선재 공격을 하면서 벌어졌던 11 전쟁의 전쟁이 이스라엘이 명령했던게 일어나는 사자였거든요. >> 그 일어나는 사자의 군사 전략이 그때는 >> 행정부가 급작스럽게 야 이제 그만해 하고 막았기 때문에 못 했는데 지금 연장 선상이라고 보시면 되겠습니다. 일어난 사자가 포요를 하는 거죠. 그러면 이제 목표는 세 가지입니다. 하나는 이란의 미사일 능력을 완전히 형화시키는 겁니다. 왜냐면 지금 이스라엘이 느끼는 가장 큰 위협은 이란의 미사일 능력이거든요. 그래서 그거를 완전히 꺾겠다. 그다음에 두 번째는 이란의 해군 전력과 해상 교량 능력. 특히 호르무주 해협을 흔들 수 있는 능력을 우리가 또 완전히 어 형회화시키겠다. 그게 이제 목적입니다. 그리고 세 번째는 본인들은 이제 핵이나 핵시설을 다에서 일환의 핵능력을 불능화시키겠다라고 하지만 뭐 전문가 입장으로서는 핵 능력을 불능화시키는 거는 쉽지는 않은 그 상황입니다. 그래서 그 자기네들의 주장은 셋째 목표는 핵시설 완전 제거지만 뭐 대다수의 전문가는 이란의 핵 그리고 그 미사일 프로그램을 완전히 엄청난 그 시간이 걸리게 지연시키는게 목적이 있다라고 해서 그 세 가지 목적을 지금이 사자의 코이요 작전에서 어 달성하려고 지금 하고 있는 것으로 보입니다. >> 예. 작년과 좀이어서 계속해서 좀 같은 목표를 관찰을 하려고 하고 있다라는 말씀인데 오늘 공격 중에는 이제 최고 지도자 하네이의 진무실 근처에도 공격이 좀 이루어졌다라는 내용이 있는데요. 당시에 하네이는 테란이 아니라 다른 곳에 있었다고 합니다. 미리 좀 이와 같은 사실을 대비를 하려고 피한 것으로 봐도 되겠습니까? 당연합니다. 왜냐면 이미 그 어 폭격을 할 수 있겠다라고 해서 2주 전부터 계속 미국이 그 폭격 능력을 극대화시키지 않았습니까? 그리고 그래서 당연히 그거에 대해서 데뷔를 하고 있었고요. 이미 작년 12월에 그 소위 말사 전환 지역에서 했던 시위 사태에서 지금 다양한 변화들이 지금 감지되고 있습니다. 무슨 말이냐면 혁명 수비라든지 아니면 그 직권 세력 성직자 그룹 내에서 이제 조금 이제 집 위에 있는 상위 지도부가 타격을 해서 없어지더라도이 세력들이 계속해서 유지하고 어 치환을 할 수 있게 좀 분절화시켜서 이렇게 배분을 했다 그러거든요. 그 과정에서 자기네들이 어떻게 어디에 숨고 어디에 이렇게 그 위치하고 그런 것들이 나름 정해졌다고 해서 지금 2주 전부터 미국의 폭격 가능성이 고조되고 있는 상황에서 어 하메이뿐만 아니라 그 혁명 수비대나 이런 그 고의 어 저 정책 결정자들은 어 분배 그 분포돼서 지금 그 운시 엄폐 그다음에 그 피해 있다고 보는 것이 정확한 분석일 것 같습니다. >> 알겠습니다. 지금 뭐 이란도 보복 공격을 시작을 했다라는 보도가 나오는 상황인데요. 이게 이스라엘을 넘어서 미국으로도 향하는 모습인데 바레인에 있는 미군 함대 기지 또 카타르, 쿠웨이트, UA에 있는 미군 기지도 공습을 했다는 내용입니다. 사실 중동에 미군 기지가 산재에 있잖아요.이 같은 이란의 보복에 대해서 미국으로서는 좀 어떻게 이어질지 전면전이 좀 걱정되기도 하는 상황입니다. >> 네.이 이 대목이 지금 말씀하신 대로 가장 위험합니다. 왜냐면 지금 어 이란이 미사일 드론 어를 이용해서 이스라엘뿐만 아니라 뭐 미군과 이스라엘 군사 거점을 겨냥했고 걸프 지역에 있는 그 미군 부대에서도 폭발이 보고되고 민간인 피어가 나고 있다라고 지금 뭐 확인은 해 봐야 되겠지만 그런 보도들이 있는데요. 미국 입장에서는 이런 미군 기지 공격이 반복되고 실제 피해자가 일어나면 참고 넘어가기 어려운 상황이 됩니다. 그러면 커분대로 전성이 이렇게 높아지는데요. 그래서 요게 가장 큰 문제점인데 한 가지 좀 제가 안심하는 부분은 이겁니다. 지금 이란에 그니까 아무리 이란이 보복을 하고 싶다 하더라도 그 의지와 그 분노 있다 하더라도 그게 실제적으로 어 효율적인 보복이 되려면 cap퍼빌리티 능력이 있어야 되거든요. 근데 지금 이란이 가용할 수 있는 그러니까 보복을 할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 제한되 있습니다. 왜냐면 우리가 다 아는 것처럼 대리전 세력은 작년 그 전쟁을 통해서 거의 형회화가 됐고 헤즈볼레나 하마스는 거의 다 형회화가 됐고 그다음에 지금 이란이 가지고 있던 그 탄도 미사일 이것도 소진이 됐었거든요. 작년 그 저쟁을 통해서. 그리고 지금 요번에 어 전쟁이 개시되면서 이스라엘과 미국이 그런 그 미사일 기지를 이란의 미사일 기지를 폭격했기 때문에 >> 이란이 지금 가용해서 미국을 공격할 수 있는 능력은 상당히 저하된 상태라고 보면 됩니다. 그러나 지금 말씀드린 대로 그래도 혹시 그 그런 가장 걱정된 상황이 이란이 지금 미사일과이라 드론을 사용해서 미군 기지나 이런 걸 공격했을 때 그리고 그 민간인 피해나 미군의 피해가 늘어났을 때는 이제 결국은 어 소위 말해서 미국도 어떤 행위를 또 강력하게 해야 되는 상황이 되면 이게 어떻게 보면 전쟁의 나선에 휩싸에 들어갈 수 있는 그런 문제가 돼서 지금이 부분이 가장 걱정이 되는 부분이죠. >> 예. 자, 일단은 뭐 확전을 하기에는 이란의 군사 능력에는 분명히 좀 한계가 있다라는 부분을 좀 짚어 주셨고요. 어, 조금 전에도 언급을 좀 여러 차례 해 주셨지만 어, 이란이 계속해서이 호르무즈 해협 세계 원유의 상당 부분이 지나는 굉장히 좀 중요한이 지역의 봉쇄 가능성을 여러 차례 좀 거론을 해왔잖아요. 여기에 대해서 우리나라를 포함해서 전 세계가 주목을 하는 상황인데 봉쇄 가능성에 대해서는 얼마나 보시는지요? 공세 가능성은 이제 어떻게이 확전 국민을 어떻게 흘러가느냐에가 결정이 될 거 같습니다. 이게 진짜이란 입장에서도 아 이게 정말 전면전이고 이제 미국이 절대력을 높이는 그런 전쟁이 아니라 우리의 순통을 끊어 놓기 위해서 이렇게 한다라고 그러면 이제이란 입장에서도 호르무 제협을 막는 것뿐만 아니라 사우디아라비아나 정유 시설 공격 뭐 이렇게 해서 정말 엔드 게임으로 아마게돈 식으로 이제 너 죽고 나 죽자 살 너 죽고 나죽자 이런 식의 공격이 된다고 한다면 이제 당연히 호르무즈 해협이 막힐 수도 있겠죠. 근데 이제 제 이야기는 아직까지는 그 정도로 완전히 극한으로 되어 치닫고 있는 상황은 아니기 때문에 조금 더 지켜봐야 된다라고 말씀을 드리고요. 그러나 만약에 호르무 세업이 막힌다면 호르무 세이 막힌다면 어 뭐 세계 석유 물동량의 20% 20% 그다음에 뭐 천연가스 20% 그리고 석유 가격도 배럴당 60에서 65달러 정도 하는게 이제 150달러 이상으로 가기 때문에 여러 가지 경제적으로 위험 어 저 여러 국가의 영향을 끼치게 되겠죠. >> 네. 알겠습니다. 뭐 우반 국가인 중국과 또 러시아의 반응도 궁금하고요. 이처럼 좀 미국과 이스라엘의 이란에 대한 전격 공습과 관련해서 백승훈 한국의대 중동구소 전임 연구원과 함께 말씀 나눠봤습니다. 박사님 감사합니다.네 >> 감사합니다. >> 네과 이스라엘이 전격적으로 이란에 대한 군사 작전을 단행했습니다. 도날드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 이란의 핵무기 위협을 제거하기 위해 작전에 돌입했다고 밝혔는데요. 이란도 즉각 반격에 나서면서 전면전 미기로 치닫고 있습니다. 이재윤 기자입니다. >> 미국과 이스라엘이 현재 시간 28일 이란에 대한 공격을 감행했습니다. 트럼프 대통령은 소셜 미디어를 통해이란 내 중대 전투를 시작했다고 밝혔습니다.')]},\n",

       "  'content': [Document(metadata={'source': 'yUrKS8KldPk'}, page_content='힐러리와 트럼프 샌더스 요즘 국내 언론에도 자주 등장하는 이름들이죠. 2016년 미국은 지금 대통령 선거전이 한창입니다. 선거 당일 국민들이 직접 투표해서 대통령을 뽑는 직접 선거 방식인 우리나라와는 달리 미국 대선은 국민과 대통령 사이에 각 주위에서 선발된 선거인단이 깨어 있습니다. 국민은 선거 인단을 직접 뽑고 선거인단이 다시 대통령을 뽑는 간접 선거 방식입니다. 게다가 코우커스니, 프라이머리니 또 슈퍼 화이리니 하면서 생소한 용어가 나오다 보니 미국 대선을 두고 복잡하다, 잘 모르겠다 이렇게 생각하시는 분들 많으실 겁니다. 그래서 미국 대선 과정을 알기 쉽게 정리해 봤습니다. 미 대선은 크게 보면 각 당에서 대통령 후보를 선출하는 경선 과정 그리고 본선일 할 수 있는 대통령 선거 과정으로 구분할 수 있습니다. 먼저 경선 과정부터 살펴보면 대원 선거와 대통령 후보 선출로 구성되 있습니다. 대의원을 먼저 뽑고 뽑힌 대원들이 전당 대회장에 모여 대통령 후보를 선출하는 거죠. 각 당의 경선 주자들은 각 줄을 돌면서 유권자들의 지지를 호소하는데 엄밀히 말하면 유권자들이 특정 후보를 뽑는게 아니라 특정 후보를 지지하는 대의원을 뽑는 겁니다. 대의원 선거는 복잡하게도 다시 두 가지 방식으로 나뉘는데 바로 코커스와 프라이머입니다. 코커스는 당원 대회 정당 집회로 당원들만 참석하는 반면 프라이머리는 당원이 아닌 일반 시민도 참여하는 대의원 선출 방식입니다. 여러 주 가운데 아이오와 코커스와 뉴 햄프쇼 프라이머리가 가장 유명한데요. 대통령 후보를 뽑는 경선의 출발점이자이 두 곳의 선거 결과가 도미너처럼 이어지는 바른 주 선거에도 영향을 끼치기 때문입니다. 아이오와 포커스와 뉴햄프쇼 프라이머리의 시작 다음에 바로 경선의 뿌트로 불리는 슈퍼 화요일이 이어집니다. 12개주에서 동시에 프라이머리가 실시되는 3월 두째 주 화요일입니다. 이날 법인 데이원수가 당의 후보를 선출하는데 필요한 베이원의 과반수를 넘어서거나 근접할 정도로 많아서 슈퍼 화요일이란 명이 붙었죠. A원들은 뽑히기 전부터 누구를 지지하는지 공개적으로 밝히기 때문에 경선주자들이 각 줄을 돌며 확보한 대의원수를 집게하면 누가 최종 후보로 결정될지 윤곽이 드러나게 말입니다. 전체 대의원수의 과반을 얻은 경선 주자가 당해 대통령 후보가 됩니다. 이렇게 선출된 대의원들이 모여 전당 대회를 열고 당해 대통령 후보를 공식적으로 선출하는데 어느 후보가 대의원의 과반을 확보했는지 이미 알고 있는 상황이라 전당 대회는 사실 후보를 지명하는 축제장이라고 볼 수 있습니다. 이렇게 당해 후보를 뽑는만 반년 정도 걸립니다. 대선 곤선은 아직 시작도 안 했는데 말했죠. 그럼 이제 각당 후보가 결정된 이후에 본선을 알아볼까요? 본선은 선거인단 선거와 대통령 선거로 구성되 있습니다. 각당 후보는 역시 전국 각주를 돌며 지지를 호소하게 됩니다. 유권자들은 지지하는 후보에게 한표를 행사하게 되는데 한 표라도 더 받은 후보가 그주에 배정된 선거인단을 모두 가져가게 됩니다. 승자 독시 구조입니다. 선거인단수는 각주의 인구수에 비례해 배정되는데 인구가 가장 많은 캘리포디아주는 쉬운 다섯 명이 알레스카 같은 곳은 세 명에 불과합니다. 그러니까 후보로선 선거인단이 큰 지역에서이기는게 중요하겠죠. 다만 메인주와 네브라스카주는 투표율대로 선거인단을 나눠갔습니다. 선거인단 총수가 538명으로 과반수인 270명의 선거인단을 확보하면 대통령에 당선됩니다. 오바마 롬니가 맛붙었던 지난 대선에선 오바마 대통령이 332명의 선거인단을 확보해 재선에 성공했습니다.이 이 특이한 승자 독시 구조 때문에 미국의 대선에서는 국민의표를 더 바꿔도 대통령이 되지 못하는 아이러니한 일이 벌어지기도 하는데요. 실제로 지난 2000년 대선에선 보호민주당 후보가 도시 공화당 후보다 유권자로부터 54만 정도를 더 받았지만 대통령이 되지 못했습니다. 유권자 총표수는 적었지만 도시 후보가 승자 독식을 통해 선거인단수를 더 많이 확보해이긴 겁니다. 선거인단 선출이 끝나면이 선거인단이 다음 달엔 12월 대선 투표를 합니다. 결과에 이미 나왔지만 말입니다. 자, 1년 동안 펼쳐지는 다섯 복잡한 미국의 대선 과정이 좀 이해되셨나요? 국제정치와 경제, 군사적 측면 등 거의 전 방면에 걸쳐 초광대국인 미국의 위상으로 볼 때 미국의 대통령이 누가 되느냐는 지구촌의 관심사이기도 합니다. 오바마 대통령에 이어 미국의 제46대 대통령은 누가 될지 전 세계가 지켜보고 습니다.')]},\n",

lion Camala Harris honestly I believe she was born that way low IQ she's a low IQ individual stupid people like K she she's a stupid person she's further left than Bernie Sanders or or Pocahontas now Pocahontas we can't stand you you're a vice president she's grossly incompetent she cannot be trusted and she is totally IL equipped to do the job of being president of the United States Camala you're fired get the hell out of here get out we're going to defeat Camala Harris I know Donald Trump's type as a prosecutor I specialized in child sexual abuse cases and sexual abuse cases well Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse and as an attorney general I held the Big Wall Street Banks accountable for fraud Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud 34 counts well [Applause] Donald I do hope you'll consider to meet me on the debate [Applause] stage because as the same goes if you got something to say my face live from the critical Battleground state of Pennsylvania Martha RIT good you have fun thank you welcome to you both it's wonderful to have you it's an honor to have you both here tonight she's a Marxist everybody knows she's a Marxist her father's a Marxist professor in economics and he taught her well but when you look at what she's done to our country and when you look at these millions and millions of people that are pouring into our country monthly it is well known he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong-un and it is absolutely wellknown that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again because they're so clear they can manipulate you with flattery and favors and let me say can afford to do it and what you are putting H and the people of America have not the majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body probably took in Springfield they're eating the dogs the people that came in they're eating the cats they're eating they're eating the pets of the people that live there Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War and what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess if Donald Trump were Pres trying to separate herself away from Biden but she can't go too far away from Biden because she's connected to you know she's got him in office right now her performance was just her rhetoric it's not anything that has been done we look at three and a half years for [Music] [Music] [Applause] TR McDonald I'm looking for a jent trump I'm Derek Jack I love McDonald's I love jobs I like to see good jobs that's pry she never worked at McDonald's McDonald's just confirmed that again by the way she never worked at McDonald's in other words she's lion kamla how are you your new baby how are you how are [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you you know even though Trump claims to be very rich uh in terms of his personal habits and and cultural instincts he actually is much closer to workingclass Americans than Democrats were well educated you know they went to IV League schools and so forth Trump likes to eat McDonald's hamburgers and he likes wrestling and he goes to you know uh these big fighting matches and you know he doesn't have refined tastes and I think that people like that I think a lot of workingclass people when they look at him even you know even his richness uh speaks to a desire of many ordinary Americans to be rich I've been my my grandma my grandma come on you have a I do that tackling inflation but day one really for kamla was she destroys everything she touches and if she wins your finances in your country will never recover you're never going to recover [Music] Trump e [Music] [Music] it is Trump has to win this where something bad is going to happen into this country and I think we're going to win this Trump is the best hey now you're working there you go buddy go Trump baby go Trump four years ago my life was so much easier than it is now we have to shop three different places whatever to just to make ends meat to buy the things we need to save some money cuz things are so expensive um Biden and KLA ruined the economy you know and Trump's going and then they open up the borders that was a that's a mess the the thing is with KLA Harris she's had over three and A2 years to do something she's been what she's been second in command you would think that she would be able to get something done and now all a sudden she's saying that she's going to do this when she's already in powerered to do it so yeah so you don't believe come as a prise no I don't believe anything she says no I do not Harris has no plan at all she doesn't know what she's doing she doesn't understand basic economics and to go around and say you must raise taxes taxes are going to have to go up no I mean it's kind of the Democrat solution is they just think you raise taxes and they collect more money to by the way spend horribly and send it to other countries and they don't do what they're supposed to do here working people felt left behind and more than that they felt looked down upon be by Elites Donald Trump promised to seek a kind of Retribution against the elites the media Elites the academic Elites the intellectual Elites who many working people felt looked down on them working people feel that Trump hears them that he listens to them drill baby drill drill baby drill drill baby drill drill baby drill we're going to have so much energy and we're going to bring prices [Music] down as far as my opinion I I believe the man has enough common sense to realize that this is this is a source of income it's a source of bargaining in the world [Music] [Music] starting on day one I will approve new drilling new pipelines new refineries new power plants new reactors and we will slash the red tape under President Trump America's future will be energy abundance energy Independence and soon we will be energy dominant we're going to be dominant [Music] at this time it is 611 12 weeks to the minute that the shooting began and I would like to ask everyone to join me in a moment of [Music] silence take over El take over [Applause] well first of all I want to say what an honor it is to be here and uh you know the the true test of someone's character is how they behave Under Fire fight fight fight blood coming down the [Applause] face I have a surprise for you uh which is that uh we are going to be awarding a million dollar to randomly to people who have signed the signed the petition every day from now until the [Applause] election had no no idea so um anyway you're [Music] welcome oh p for Y and I think that what's different about the second Trump Administration is that uh he now has had some practice in particular he also knows how to wield executive Authority in a way that could really change the bureaucracy so to the extent that there will be noticeable changes it will probably be uh fundamental changes to the federal bureaucracy under no circumstances you are promising America tonight you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody except for day one except for he's going crazy except for day one meaning [Applause] [Music] us leadership has been undermined uh not by other countries but by the US South Korea is an example of a country that has benefited from international trade and the International Security order uh and so I would understand if Koreans are particularly worried about this good to see you do okay let's do South Korea I love South Korea they're wonderful people extremely ambitious they have a money machine we protect them from North Korea for no drugs no alcohol no cigarettes raise your hands kids I promise Donald J Trump that I will never take drugs I will never take drugs I don't want to say no alcohol but take it easy on the Alcohol right and you know what else no cigarettes right all right kids come here come here and I think you the Washington Monument you keep learning you keep trying and you keep dreaming one day you might be standing exactly right here where I'm standing I want to tell you it's not that [Applause] easy the hard and difficult questions will be will he really be able to make life better for the voters who put their faith in him in tangible ways or will he his presidency simply be an instrument of grievance four years of Retribution and retaliation against enemies and the expression of grievance that will be the question [Applause] [Applause] myir [Music]\")]},\n",
